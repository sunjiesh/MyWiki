warning: refname 'b8a9ef99a2b0dd350ef9bf4c865a5111837ae56a' is ambiguous.
Git normally never creates a ref that ends with 40 hex characters
because it will be ignored when you just specify 40-hex. These refs
may be created by mistake. For example,

  git checkout -b $br $(git rev-parse ...)
  
  where "$br" is somehow empty and a 40-hex ref is created. Please
  examine these refs and maybe delete them. Turn this message off by
  running "git config advice.objectNameWarning false"
